# Slime Rancher - Trading Mod
An online trading mod for SlimeRancher


## About the Mod
Me and my player 2 have been playing Slime Rancher together a lot. But because there is no multiplayer, we weren't able to really share things, or give eachother resources, slimes or other things whenever we had loads, and the other needed some.  
This led to me making this mod. It doesn't give you a full multiplayer experience, but it does allow you to share resources, plorts, and even slimes with your player 2, or even a bunch of friends, with the power of the internet!

<br>

## What it does
The mod allows you to host and connect to other people, and then syncs the contents of any warp depot's with whomever you're connected with. It's safe to use with existing save files, and can be removed at any time without harming your save file.

It adds a Amber Warp Depot next to the market, so if you start a new game, you'll have access to sharing things right away! But it'll work for every Warp Depot, even ones you already placed.  
The mod allows for putting even slimes into the Depot's, as a bonus side effect this also allows you to store slimes into storage silo's.

<br>

## How to use it
It's very easy. 
1. You press the semicolon ( ; ) button in game to open up the connection UI. 
2. One person presses the 'host' button, and they'll be the host.
3. Everyone that wants to connect to them fills in the host's IP, and presses 'connect' (just google "what is my ip?")
4. Put something in a warp depot and the others can take it out. (the mod will spawn one between your house and the market place for you to use)
And all done!

<br>

## A small heads up
When first connecting, the contents in warp depots on the host's side will overwrite those of anyone connecting, even if they're empty. So make sure it's either the same or your side is empty before connecting.  
The mod doesn't check for save file reloading, so it is possible to lose or duplicate items that way, which won't harm anything, but could be seen as cheating. This is in your own hands however.

You can find a guide on how to install it [here](https://umodframework.com/wiki/Install_Guide).  
Some antiviruses will flag it as a treat because it makes use of code injection to be able to apply changes to the game, just as a heads up.
